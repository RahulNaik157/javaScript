History of JavaScript (JS)
1995 -> Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape  in just 10 days.

Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, finally renamed JavaScript (even though it's not related to java).

Designed to add interactivity to web pages.

Standardized under ECMAScript (first standard in 1997).

Grew over time from small script -> full web apps + backend (Node.js) -> desktop & mobile apps.

What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a high-level interpreted, multi-paradigm progamming langage.

It runs mainly in the browser but also on servers (Node.js).

It's dynamic (types can change), even-driven, amd supports object-oriented, funcitonal, and imperative styles.

Often paired with HTML + CSS to build web apps.    
Why JavaScript?
Browser-native -> Runs directly in all modern broswers.                                                                           

Versatile -> Frontend (React, Vue), backend (NOde.js) mobile (React Native), desktop (Electron), IOT, and even AI/ML.

Massive ecosystem -> Libraries, frameworks, NPM packages.

Active community - Tons of tools, tutorials, and updates.                                                                      

Asynchronous -> Handles events, promises, APIs smoothly.             

Uses Cases of JavaScript
Building interactive websites(animations, form validation, dynamic content).
Developng single-page applications (SPAs) (React, Angular, Vue).
Creating mobile apps (React Native, Ionic).
Writing backend services (Node.js + express).
Making desktop apps (Electron, Tauri).
Building brower extenstions
Working with real-time apps (Chats, Live, Updates, WebSockets).
Even game development, IoT projects, and machine learning experiments.
